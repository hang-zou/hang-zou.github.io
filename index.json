Agents are not aware of their LoA and are willing to estimate it without the help of a central classification authority, in order to determine whether their contribution will improve or degrade the performance of the global network. Using their estimated LoA, agents may then voluntarily restrain themselves to participate to the activity of the multi-agent system, without being banned by some central control authority. For that purpose, agents, when they meet, perform pairwise comparison tests (PCT) able to determine which is the best agent of a pair of competing agents. Two maximum empha posteriori (MAP) estimators of the LoA of each agent are proposed using the results of several PCTs. These MAP estimators are then employed to determine, for a given agent, the LoA of the next opponent that minimizes its probability of LoA estimation error. Simulations results show that the proposed optimal opponent selection approach provides better results than simply choosing opponents at random, or always choosing the opponents with the best LoA.","tags":null,"title":"hang-GLOBECOM-2018","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chao Zhang Hang Zou","Lucas Saludjian Samson Lasaulce","Patrick Panciatici"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538344800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538344800,"objectID":"f046fc97c6dcf3d7f66c44efa26908a8","permalink":"http://hang-zou.github.io/publication/hang-zou-hang-wincom-2018-2018/","publishdate":"2018-10-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/hang-zou-hang-wincom-2018-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we introduce the problem of decision-oriented communications, that is, the goal of the source is to send the right amount of information in order for the intended destination to execute a task. More specifically, we restrict our attention to how the source should quantize information so that the destination can maximize a utility function which represents the task to be executed only knowing the quantized information. For example, for utility functions under the form u (x; g), x might represent a decision in terms of using some radio resources and g the system state which is only observed through its quantized version Q(g). Both in the case where the utility function is known and the case where it is only observed through its realizations, we provide solutions to determine such a quantizer. We show how this approach applies to energy-efficient power allocation. In particular, it is seen that quantizing the state very roughly is perfectly suited to sum-rate-type function maximization, whereas energy-efficiency metrics are more sensitive to imperfections.","tags":null,"title":"hang-WINCOM-2018","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chao Zhang Hang Zou","Samson Lasaulce"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535752800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535752800,"objectID":"8feef15ee6278599b882e5c0ae518cac","permalink":"http://hang-zou.github.io/publication/hang-zou-hang-pimrc-2018-2018/","publishdate":"2018-09-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/hang-zou-hang-pimrc-2018-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we propose a new perspective for quantizing a signal and more specifically the channel state information (CSI). The proposed point of view is fully relevant for a receiver which has to send a quantized version of the channel state to the transmitter. Roughly, the key idea is that the receiver sends the right amount of information to the transmitter so that the latter be able to take its (resource allocation) decision. More formally, the decision task of the transmitter is to maximize a utility function fpx; gq with respect to x (e.g., a power allocation vector) given the knowledge of a quantized version of the function parameters g. We exhibit a special case of an energy-efficient power control (PC) problem for which the optimal task oriented CSI quantizer (TOCQ) can be found analytically. For more general utility functions, we propose to use neural networks (NN) based learning. Simulations show that the compression rate obtained by adapting the feedback information rate to the function to be optimized may be significantly increased.","tags":null,"title":"hang-PIMRC-2018","type":"publication"}]

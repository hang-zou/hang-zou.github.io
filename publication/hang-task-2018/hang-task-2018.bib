 abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new perspective
for quantizing a signal and more specifically the channel state information (CSI). The proposed point of view is
fully relevant for a receiver which has to send a quantized
version of the channel state to the transmitter. Roughly,
the key idea is that the receiver sends the right amount of
information to the transmitter so that the latter be able to
take its (resource allocation) decision. More formally, the
decision task of the transmitter is to maximize an utility
function u(x;g) with respect to x (e.g., a power allocation
vector) given the knowledge of a quantized version of the
function parameters g. We exhibit a special case of an
energy-efficient power control (PC) problem for which the
optimal task oriented CSI quantizer (TOCQ) can be found
analytically. For more general utility functions, we propose
to use neural networks (NN) based learning. Simulations
show that the compression rate obtained by adapting the
feedback information rate to the function to be optimized
may be significantly increased.},
